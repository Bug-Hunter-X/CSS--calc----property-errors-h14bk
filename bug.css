The CSS property `calc()` is used incorrectly, causing unexpected behavior. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` inside a `width` property might not work as expected if the parent element's width isn't explicitly defined.  Another issue can occur when combining different units within `calc()`, such as `calc(100px + 5em)`, which might lead to unexpected results depending on the context.
